Summary of interesting talks at useR2017

All talks were recorded, probably eventually available on 
https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2017

- partools "Leave it there" alternative to MapReduce/spark by Norm
  Matloff. "Software Alchemy" which means computing some estimates on
  data subsets on different computers, than averaging those estimates
  (Not technically correct, but works fine). 
- h2o.autoML -- makes it easy to run several ML algos on your data,
  select the one which is most accurate (usually the stacked version).
- crispRvariants Bioconductor package
  https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CrispRVariants.html
- CHMM won best poster prize, Coupled Hidden Markov models for joint
  copy number variant detection (in families/trios).
  https://cran.r-project.org/package=CHMM
- Transformation trees https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/ctm can
  be used to learn a nonlinear regression function with censored
  outputs.
- Really nice presentation about deep convolutional neural networks
  for text classification. Letter-level 1-hot encoding, mxnet R
  package, implementation of model from LeCun 2015 paper.
- containerit package for automatically archiving reproducible studies
  with docker. https://user2017.sched.com/event/AxqM/automatically-archiving-reproducible-studies-with-docker?iframe=yes&w=&sidebar=yes&bg=no#
- List of all R packages on github, produced daily. Currently over
  40,000. http://rpkg.gepuro.net/
- My tutorial about changepoint detection https://github.com/tdhock/change-tutorial
- Structural equation modeling, like graphical models, R pkg
  lavaan. "Why do we keep doing this?" (writing/maintaining R
  packages) To learn more about the models, the algos, stats,
  maths. Meet interesting people, more interesting than writing
  papers. Free/open-source software is too important.
- Really cool talk about data depth, some kind of non-parametric
  density estimate, very elegant geometric interpretation, but hard to
  compute in a reasonable amount of time, R pkg ddalpha.
- A couple of interesting talks about digital PCR, alternative to
  qPCR.https://user2017.sched.com/event/AxsV/integrated-analysis-of-digital-pcr-experiments-in-r
  https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/recount.html
- 20 years of CRAN, awesome keynote by Uwe Ligges.
