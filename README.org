- [[https://channel9.msdn.com/events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/KEYNOTE-Parallel-Computation-in-R-What-We-Want-and-How-We-Might-Get-It?term%3Dmatloff][Norm Matloff]] partools "Leave it there" alternative to
  MapReduce/spark by Norm Matloff. "Software Alchemy" which means
  computing some estimates on data subsets on different computers,
  than averaging those estimates (Not technically correct, but works
  fine).
- [[https://channel9.msdn.com/events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/Room-402-Lightning-Talks?term%3Dautoml%2520lightning][Erin Ledell]] h2o.autoML -- makes it easy to run several ML algos on
  your data, select the one which is most accurate (usually the
  stacked version).
- [[https://channel9.msdn.com/events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/Transformation-Forests?term%3Dtransformation][Torsten Hothorn]] Transformation trees https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/ctm can
  be used to learn a nonlinear regression function with censored
  outputs.
- [[https://channel9.msdn.com/events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/Deep-Learning-for-Natural-Language-Processing-in-R?term%3Ddeep%2520convolutional%2520][Angus Taylor]] Really nice presentation about deep convolutional neural networks
  for text classification. Letter-level 1-hot encoding, mxnet R
  package, implementation of model from LeCun 2015 paper.
- [[https://channel9.msdn.com/events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/Automatically-archiving-reproducible-studies-with-Docker?term%3Dcontainerit][Daniel Nust]] containerit package for automatically archiving reproducible studies
  with docker. https://user2017.sched.com/event/AxqM/automatically-archiving-reproducible-studies-with-docker?iframe=yes&w=&sidebar=yes&bg=no#
- [[https://channel9.msdn.com/events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/Introduction-to-optimal-changepoint-detection-algorithms?term%3Dhocking][My]] tutorial with [[https://channel9.msdn.com/events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/Introduction-to-optimal-changepoint-detection-algorithms-II?term%3Dhocking][Rebecca Killick]] about changepoint detection
  https://github.com/tdhock/change-tutorial
- [[https://channel9.msdn.com/events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/KEYNOTE-Structural-Equation-Modeling-models-software-and-stories?term%3Dstrucutral%2520equation%2520modeling][Yves Rosseel]] Structural equation modeling, like graphical models, R pkg
  lavaan. "Why do we keep doing this?" (writing/maintaining R
  packages) To learn more about the models, the algos, stats,
  maths. Meet interesting people, more interesting than writing
  papers. Free/open-source software is too important.
- [[https://channel9.msdn.com/events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/Depth-and-depth-based-classification-with-R-package-ddalpha?term%3Ddata%2520depth][Oleksii Pokotylo]] Really cool talk about data depth, some kind of non-parametric
  density estimate, very elegant geometric interpretation, but hard to
  compute in a reasonable amount of time, R pkg ddalpha.
- A couple of interesting talks about digital PCR, alternative to
  qPCR. https://user2017.sched.com/event/AxsV/integrated-analysis-of-digital-pcr-experiments-in-r

- [[https://channel9.msdn.com/events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/KEYNOTE-20-years-of-CRAN?term%3Duwe%2520ligges][Uwe Ligges]] 20 years of CRAN, awesome keynote by Uwe Ligges. He recommended to
  use R CMD check on the command line rather than in
  Rstudio/devtools. I asked about CRAN support for old package
  versions. His response was that CRAN is more concerned with checking
  that the current packages are working together (and that checking
  all combinations of new/old versions would be computationally
  intractable).
